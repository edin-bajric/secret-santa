# Secret Santa implementation using PostgreSQL, Spring Boot, and React

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of a Secret Santa application.\
Registered employees are randomly assigned a Secret Santa recipient.\
When the employees log in, they can see who they are assigned to buy a gift for.\
There are two types of users: Admin and Employee.\
Admins have the access to the dashboard where they can generate the Secret Santa assignments and view all the paired and unassigned employees.\
Employees can only view their own assignments.\
The unassigned employees are the employees who have not been assigned a Secret Santa recipient.\
The employees (and admins) can register, log in, and log out.\
